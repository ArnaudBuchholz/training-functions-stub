# User Story 2

As a developer, I want to know how many times a spied function has been called in order to check this information in my tests

## Acceptance criteria

* it exposes the property "called" the indicates if the function was called
* it exposes the property "callCount" that indicates how often the function was called

## Lesson Objectives

* DRY: factorize the two acceptances criteria content
* Clean test cases
* [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) & Asynchronous synchronisation
* [Closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
